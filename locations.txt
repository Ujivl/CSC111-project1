U see the coach using your lucky pen. When u ask for it, he says "finders keepers!" maybe you can trade for it?
The gym coach now satisfied with his other pen does not seem to care about yours.
You are inside the gym. It reeks of sweat and hardwork. To the west lies the Quad.
You are now inside the UofT gym, greeted by the distinct smell of studentâ€™s tears and sweat, from their years of
mental and physical hardships. The gym, equipped with the latest technology gives students an opportunity to improve
their mental and physical health. There are little to no students to be seen. The air smells particularly pungent
today, but you do not take notice of it. You suddenly remember that you used the treadmill during one of your many
escapades to focus on studying. The quad, where you began your journey, lies to the west.

The barista at the cafeteria is selling some limited stock extra potent coffee, but in exchange for some of your score..
The barista seems somewhat melancholic now that she's run out of coffee to sell.
You enter the cafeteria. To the north, you'll find the quad, and to the south lies Bahen.
You enter the cafeteria. The cafeteria is a safe haven for students, who take breaks in between studying to grab a
quick, but delicious bite. The cafeteria accommodates and serves all, regardless of any dietary restrictions, making it
one of your favourite places on campus. While pondering, you think the only item it does not serve is a good home
cooked meal, which you have not had in a while.
