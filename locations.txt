You are now inside the UofT gym, greeted by the distinct smell of studentâ€™s tears and sweat, from their years of
mental and physical hardships. The gym, equipped with the latest technology gives students an opportunity to improve
their mental and physical health. There are little to no students to be seen. The air smells particularly pungent
today, but you do not take notice of it. You suddenly remember that you used the treadmill during one of your many
escapades to focus on studying. The quad, where you began your journey, lies to the west.

cooked meal, which you have not had in a while.
