0-LIBRARY RECEPTION
librarian.txt
10
You are standing at the front door of the library.
You are now inside the library. Around you are happiness deprived students, all wishing exam season was over so they
could finally relax. You examine the desk you were working at last night and see the mountain of eraser debris on the
floor. Your eraser, now the mere size of a pea, helped you to make the perfect cheat sheet. The librarian is right next
to you, but you did not see her in the room prior to this, almost as if she appeared from thin air. She scolds you for
making a mess in her library and asks you to clean up after yourself. You apologise profusely and start cleaning the
eraser debris.

You are standing in the middle of the quad. To the west lies the library, to the East, there is the UofT gym.
You are standing in the middle of the quad. You need to act quickly or else you might not make it to your exam! Around
you are multiple buildings where you spent last night studying for your exam. You look around and notice the campus is
now filled with magic, and strange creatures have appeared out of nowhere! Your upper year friend approaches you and
states that the concentrated lack of sleep in the area has caused weird things to happen, and there are monsters
surrounding the area. Your journey to get to the exam hall has gotten exponentially harder, as now you must get your
items without getting eaten to make it to the exam on time. The quad connects to most of the important buildings you
go to on a daily basis and can be used to access the map. Your friend state’s before you can access the map that you
must solve this riddle so they can see that you are capable of going to the exam:

brief description
You are now inside of the UofT gym, greeted by the distinct smell of student’s tears and sweat, from their years of
mental and physical hardships. The gym, equipped with the latest technology gives students an opportunity to improve
their mental and physical health. There are little to no students to be seen. The air smells particularly pungent
today, but you do not take notice of it. You suddenly remember that you used the treadmill during one of your many
escapades to focus on studying. The quad, where you began your journey, lies to the west.

You enter the cafeteria. To the north, you'll find the quad, and to the south lies the CS building.
You enter the cafeteria. The cafeteria is a safe haven for students, who take breaks in between studying to grab a
quick, but delicious bite. The cafeteria accommodates and serves all, regardless of any dietary restrictions, making it
one of your favourite places on campus. While pondering, you think the only item it does not serve is a good home
cooked meal, which you have not had in a while.

You enter the TTC subway station. The sounds of birds envelopes your ears. The park buzzes with activity as student
shuffle around. During your insane studying journey last night, you remember you went to Queen's Park for a change in
environment. As you try to remember what happened, you notice a faint aroma of freshly brewed coffee lingering in the
air. The CS building is positioned in the north, and to the west, you'll find the exam hall.
